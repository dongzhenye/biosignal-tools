biosig4c++ (1.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * support for additional data formats
       ABF1, AXG, 
  * support improved for 
       CFS (performance, scaling), SCP (convert strings to UTF-8), 
       ISHNE, HEKA (TimeStamps, performance), MFER, IGOR
  * bug fixes in supported data formats: 
       EDF+, ITX, HEKA (scaling), CFS

  * JSON output format for header added. 

  * ABI changed:
    The size of some structs, and some enumeration types have changed.
    Most likely, You'll need to recompile your application, even if 
    the dynamic biosig library (.so, .dll) is used.

  * API change: field CHANNEL->PhysDim is removed.
     This is already deprecated for quite a while.
     Use instead the function PhysDim3(CHANNEL->PhysDimCode)

biosig4c++ (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fresh upstream release
    - libbiosig now SOVERSION 1, thus libbiosig1{,-dbg} to replace
      libbiosig0
  * debian/copyright: updated for DEP5
  * debian/patches:
    - added up_memcpy_str_cast (sent upstream)
    - removed up_for_loop_initial (upstreamed)
    - removed up_*oct* (no hardcoded octave version information in
      upstream Makefile any longer), deb_link_dynamically_python
    - removed deb_link_dynamically in favor of specifying LIBEXT=so to
      calls to make
    - removed deb_use_borrowed_eventcodes: now debian/upstream-extern
      provides needed extra external files (from biosig) and gets symlinked
      as extern at build time
    - refreshed deb_no_mex_copy_upstairs,deb_no_locals
  * upstream-files/eventcodes.txt -- refreshed from online
  * debian/control:

biosig4c++ (0.96.3+svn2677-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACK the .1 NMU (Thank you Miguel)
    - debian/rules: call dh_numpy only if available
  * Use unversioned mkoctfile (Closes: #665051).
    Thanks Lucas Nussbaum for the report and Nicolas Bourdaud for the patch.
  * debian/rules, debian/control
    - fixed typo in debian/control resulting in octave:Depends
    - adjusted conditional use of octave-depends across systems (should
      generate octave:Depends subst for recent systems lacking
      octave-depends)
  * debian/patches: refreshed
