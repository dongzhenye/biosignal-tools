== Compiling on Debian and derivatives ===============

== 1. REQUIREMENTS ==

   sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev libz-dev


== 2. DOWNLOAD ==
   and extract biosig4c++ and change into directory
   cd biosig4c++/

or checkout the latest version from the git repository

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/biosig/code biosig-code
   cd biosig-code/biosig4c++/

== 3. COMPILATION ==

   make libbiosig.a
   make mma

At the end, there are certainly some error messages, caused by the
failed attempt of copying
  mma/sload to ../../mma/
you can ignore these. The important part is whether the file
   mma/sload
has been built.

If it fails (file mma/sload not available), you might need to edit
mma/Makefile (line 18)

  MLINKDIR=

set it to the directory of the developerkit of your mathematica
installation.

Try again
  make mma


== 4. INSTALL ==
copy the files

  mma/sload mma/*.nb

into your working directory.

== 5. USAGE ==
Start mathematica

   link=Install["sload"]
   ?sload

mySLOAD.nb zeigt wie man sload in mathematica verwendet.


=== OTHER PLATFORMS === 
 are currently not maintained. The information below might be outdated. 


    


   = Compiling on Windows =
   Prerequisites: 
	MinGW 
	Mathematica (tested with v7.0) 
	Download and extract sources of biosig4c++ (v0.96.2 or later)
	Start MinGW shell 

		cd biosig4c++/mma
		make -f Makefile.win32 sload.exe 


   = Cross-Compiling on Linux for Windows =
   Prerequisites:
	Cross-compiler (e.g. mxe)
        wine 
	Mathlink developer files from Windows 
		e.g. C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\7.0\SystemFiles\Links\MathLink\DeveloperKit\Windows*
	to the linux computer (copyied them into the corresponding Mathematica directory on linux)
		e.g. /usr/local/Wolfram/gridMathematicaServer/7.0/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/
	Adapt the user-defined variables in Makefile.win32
	and run 

    make sload.exe


===== TESTING =========================================
The installation can be tested by starting Mathematica, loading and running test.nb.
